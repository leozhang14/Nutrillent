# Reconfig of Nutrillent Website

Originally named "GLED Nutrient Tracker" and created as a prototype for the online virtual hackathon "Hack the Pulse 2022".

After the hackathon ended, I finished programming the web app on my own and renamed it to "Nutrillent". As my skills improve, I hope to continue working on this project and continue to make it better. Recent updates include using React to allow table row deletion and editing with a running total.

Nutritional information was retrieved from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) FoodData Central API.

Deployed using Microsoft Azure.
